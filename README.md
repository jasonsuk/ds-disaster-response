# Disaster Response Pipeline

To analyze disater data provided by Figure Eight and build pipelines
ready for an API that will classify disaster messages.

This project covers a work to build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline
that includes cleaning and preprocessing the data and loading them to SQL database.

Subsequently, a machine learning model is built to classify the dister messages,
using natural language processing and Scikit-learn's pipeline with the best parameters sorted through Grid Search.

## Deliverables

The project will produce some Python files. The scripts will be ready to process future data and
can be loaded onto a web app where users can type a message and get visualized classification results.
